        <p align="center" style="padding-top:50px">TEC is a student-run organization at the University of Pennsylvania. Our goal is to bring out the entrepreneur within us and foster student collaboration to spread our passion for technology and entrepreneurship to the UPenn campus. We host different types of events that range from speakers, trips to local businesses, and student-run workshops. TEC aims to expose students to booming businesses and the technologies around which they were formed.</p><br></br>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Engage:</strong> We strive to connect students with start-up companies and other students for potential collaboration.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Empower:</strong> We provide guidance to students so that they can create their own start up company.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Envision:</strong> We provide guidance and consulting for students who wish to create their own start up company.</p><hr>
        <p align="center" style="padding-bottom:30px">As a club, we function through our committees. The committees are a great way to get more involved at TEC. Through committees you get the chance to influence the direction our club takes, and directly work on different sectors within the club. Our committees include:</p>
        <p><strong>Finance:</strong> Responsible for requesting funding for the club and maintaining records of the club&#8217;s finances. The committee is in charge of approved spending and exploring new ways to obtain funding.</p>
        <p><strong>Events:</strong> This committee makes sure that Finance, Marketing, External Relations, and all the other sections of the club are able to come together put on a successful event.</p>
        <p><strong>Conference:</strong> Primarily responsible to work within the whole organization to create an overarching technologically themed conference</p>
        <p><strong>Marketing: </strong>Focuses on raising event awareness, public representation of TEC. We deal with social media, manage the TEC website, and are the liaison between the club and the student community</p>
        <p><strong>External Affairs: </strong>Point of contact between TEC and startups, we collaborate and build relationships with startups within the area. Joining this committee is a great way to directly interact with founders of exciting startups.</p>
        <p><strong>Internal Affairs: </strong>Provide professional and social relationships with other professional organizations. We also act as a liaison between the club and the SEAS Umbrella (SEAS Council, ESAC, etc.). Lastly we promote TEC within SEAS by collaborating with other club committees.</p>
        <p><strong>Research: </strong>Divided into three sub committees, Penn startups, Local startups in Philadelphia, Entrepreneurship 101 and aim to publish 3 newsletter this semester.</p>
